  "text": "PartySafe Medics strives to create a model for the future of nightlife and event safety, in which guestâ€™s well-being is top priority. On a company-level, that means holding ourselves accountable in making sure we are always learning and training, emphasizing harm reduction and empowering (yet informative) safer-partying education, keeping up with research and cultural developments, and holding event venues and promotions accountable by providing feedback on ways they can better uphold their responsibilities to their customers. On a grander scale, it involves advocating for regulations including requiring access to free water and bathrooms based on guest capacity.",
