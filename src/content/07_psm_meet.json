  "text": "Meet The Staff: Brian Hackel (he, him), event medic and founder of PartySafe Medics, is a New York State-licensed Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), drug and alcohol counselor (CASAC), and safer drug use and overdose prevention and intervention trainer. While his own experiences originally lead him to pursue addiction medicine, he became involved in harm reduction spaces and drug policy activism in 2017. He has since supervised OnPoint NYC’s Overdose Prevention Center in Washington Heights for nearly 3 years. He also now provides prevention counseling and safer drug use trainings at various hospitals for New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  Brian has provided medic services at raves, protests, festivals, conferences, fairs, and concerts. Prior venues include Pier 17, Rockefeller Center, Brooklyn Navy Shipyard, Nowadays, Metrograph, and more. Realizing the need for comprehensive medic coverage that focuses on harm reduction at parties, Brian officially launched PartySafe Medics in December, 2024, and considers it an honor to provide medic support for partygoers in New York City.",
